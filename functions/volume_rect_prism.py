# Do all of this in a .py file in Pycharm.
#
# For this programming challenge, you will be creating a function that calculates the volume of a rectangular prism in cubic feet.  The formula to find the volume of a rectangular prism is V = l * w * h where l, w, and h are length, width, and height, respectively.
#
# First, create three variables representing length, width, and height.   Assign each of them an integer as user input using the input() function and int().
#
# Next, create a function to calculate the volume of the rectangular prism.  It should have 3 parameters representing length, width, and height and return the volume of a rectangular prism calculated using those 3 parameters.
#
# Finally, use print() to display "The volume of the rectangular prism is [call function  here to calculate volume] cubic feet." in the output.  You will have to use str() on the function call to be able to concatenate it with strings since it returns an integer.
#


length = int(input("Enter an integer that represents length in feet."))
width = int(input("Enter an integer that represents width in feet."))
height = int(input("Enter an integer that represents height in feet."))


def prism_vol(l, w, h):
    return l * w * h


print("The volume of the rectangular prism is " + str(prism_vol(length, width, height)) + " cubic feet.")
