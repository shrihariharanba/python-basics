# For this exercise, start by creating a variable and assigning it a randomly generated integer between and inclusive of both 1 and 10.
#
# Then, using your knowledge of if, elif, and else statements, create a program which prints the roman numeral equivalent of the randomly generated number.
#
# For example, if the randomly generated integer was 9, then the program would say that the roman numeral equivalent of 9 is IX in the output.
