# Write a program which gets a positive integer from a user using input() and assigns it to a variable.
#
# The program should then use a while loop to get the sum of all of the integers from the integer that was entered by the user down to 1.  For example, if the integer entered by the user was 6, the while loop would find the sum of 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1, which is 21.
#
# At the bottom of your program create two print statements.  One will display the user entered integer and the other will display the sum found by the while loop.

###########################################################################################
# pos_int is a variable which holds a user entered integer.
pos_int = int(input("Please enter a positive integer."))
# This variable stores the initial value of pos_int before it is used in the loop so
# that later it can be used to display pos_int's initial value in the output.
int_init = pos_int
# This is a variable which will be used to hold the sum of all the integers from pos_int.
summed = 0
# The while loop will run while pos_int's stored integer value is greater than 0
while pos_int > 0:
    # This is the equivalent of summed = summed + pos_int
    # In other words: new value of summed = old value of summed + new value of pos_int
    summed += pos_int
    # This will decrement pos_int so that pos_int will eventually equal 0 and the while
    # loop will stop running its code.
    pos_int -= 1

print(int_init)  # displays the initial value of pos_int
print(summed)  # displays the sum of integers from pos_int
