# Create a variable and assign it the sum of two integers
#
# Create a variable and assign it the difference of two integers
#
# Create a variable and assign it the result of one integer being divided by another integer
#
# Create a variable and assign it the product of two integers
#
# Create a variable and assign it the result of 3 raised to the 8th power
#
# Create a variable and assign it the result of 10 floor division 3
#
# Create a variable and assign it the integer 2 using the expression 17 modulo [number]

summed = 2 + 3
difference = 10 - 8
divided = 1000 / 10
product = 7 * 5
exponent = 3 ** 8
floored = 10 // 3
mod = 17 % 15  # could have used 3, 5, or 15 to get 2 as a result
