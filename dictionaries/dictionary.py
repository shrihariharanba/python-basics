# Do all of this in a .py file in Pycharm.
#
# create a variable and assign it a dictionary that has 5 key value pairs
#
# print and access the value held at the third key in the dictionary
#
# use the in keyword to check if a key appears in the dictionary and print the result
#
# use not in to check if a key does not appear in the dictionary and print the result
#

# example solution
dictionary = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 5}
print(dictionary["c"])
print("a" in dictionary)
print("b" not in dictionary)
